    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",

One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",

    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "From this question we can find that the characteristic point of the problem is whether these people's income is >=50K, we can use the following model to predict:  Decision Tree, AdaBoost Classifier, Support Vector Machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Decision Trees: \n",
    "1. Application: Automated mechanical application\n",
    "2. Strength:Decision trees are a useful binary classification method that can generate increasingly complex classifications based on features.\n",
    "3. Weaknesses:Changes in data can have a large impact on the results, and overly complex classifications can cause overfitting.\n",
    "4. Know about:On this dataset, the situation is very simple, we have a large set of binary tags, so the results should be ideal.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ensemble Methods(AdaBoost): \n",
    "1. Application: Face Detection\n",
    "2. Strength:It is not susceptible to overfitting and performs well if you have a large number of discrete tags and non-sequence data.\n",
    "3. Weaknesses:Very susceptible to abnormalities and noise.\n",
    "4. Know about:I think ADABOOST is suitable for this problem because it can generate powerful learners by analyzing the relationship between various features and their impact on income probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Support Vector Machines (SVM): \n",
    "1. Application: Handwritten digit recognition\n",
    "2. Strength:Extremely fast at prediction time, And have powerful kernels, maximum margin classifiers.\n",
    "3. Weaknesses:If the data set is too large, it may take a lot of time. Also if the data sets are similar, it may cause overfitting.\n",
    "4. Know about:It supports kernels, so can handle non-linearly separable classification problems. There are some characteristics in the data that can describe the horizontal edge of this income. I think this is a candidate model."

    "Adaboost is a boosting type ensemble learner.\n",
    "Boosting, also known as enhanced learning or promotion, is an important integrated learning technique that enhances weak learners with only slightly higher prediction accuracy than random guesses into strong learners with high prediction accuracy. In very difficult circumstances, it provides an effective new idea and new method for the design of learning algorithms. The most successful application is the AdaBoost algorithm proposed by Yoav Freund and Robert Schapire in 1995.\n",
    "AdaBoost is an abbreviation of \"Adaptive Boosting\" in English. Its adaptation is that the weight of the sample that is misclassified by the previous basic classifier will increase, and the weight of the correctly classified sample will decrease and be used again for training. The next basic classifier. At the same time, in each iteration, a new weak classifier is added until a predetermined sufficiently small error rate is reached or a pre-specified maximum number of iterations is reached to determine the final strong classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "AdaBoost is very useful in this case because of the large sample size compared to other classification algorithms, and AdaBoost has a continuous reduction in overall errors when using a sufficiently large data set for training.\n",
    "One of the biggest advantages is that AdaBoost can integrate many different learner objects and provide more choices for implementation when building new classifiers or researching other generalization methods."

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
